# All-js-needed-to-react
All the #javascript  needed to start writing #react . 

( From my point of view if you do understand these you have the basics knowledge to start diving into #reactjs  ) 

Please have a look maybe let me know if I dropped something or need to add something.

The aim of this repository is to create a #reference  that we go back for if forgot or not sure about something.
